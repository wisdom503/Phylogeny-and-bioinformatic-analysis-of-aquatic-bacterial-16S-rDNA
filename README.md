# Phylogeny-and-bioinformatic-analysis-of-aquatic-bacterial-16S-rDNA
This repository contains several codes essential for analysis of  aquatic bacterioplankton sequence data under warming and nutrient enrichment

The codes were arranged and tested well for phylogenetic analysis, if you use them, wholely or partly, please cite this article "Ren L, He D , Chen Z, Jeppesen E, Lauridsen TL, SÃ¸ndergaard M , Wu QL . (2017). Warming and nutrient enrichment in combination increase stochasticity and beta diversity of bacterioplankton assemblages across freshwater mesocosms. The ISME Journal,11,613-625."
